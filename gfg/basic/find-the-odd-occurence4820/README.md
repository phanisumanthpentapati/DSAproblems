![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an array of  **arr[]** positive integers where all numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Return that number.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input:arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3]
Output: 3
Explaination: 3 occurs three times.

```

```
Input:arr[] = [5, 7, 2, 7, 5, 2, 5]
Output: 5
Explaination: 5 occurs three times.

```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106

        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            ans = ans ^ arr[i];
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
