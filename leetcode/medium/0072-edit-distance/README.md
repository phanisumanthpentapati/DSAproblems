## Problem

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return  *the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`*.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
  public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
    final int m = word1.length();//first word length
    final int n = word2.length();///second word length
    // dp[i][j] := min # of operations to convert word1[0..i) to word2[0..j)
    int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
      dp[i][0] = i;

    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
      dp[0][j] = j;

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
      for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
        if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1))//same characters
          dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];//no operation
        else
          dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])) + 1;                      //replace               //delete        //insert

    return dp[m][n];
  }
}
```
