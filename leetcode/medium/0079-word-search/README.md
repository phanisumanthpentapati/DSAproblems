# Word Search

## Problem

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true`  *if*  `word`  *exists in the grid*.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- m == board.length
- n = board[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 6
- 1 <= word.length <= 15
- board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

        // Character doesn't match
        if (board[i][j] != word.charAt(index)) {
            return false;
        }

        // Mark as visited
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '#';

        // Try 4 directions
        boolean found =
            dfs(board, word, i - 1, j, index + 1) ||  // up
            dfs(board, word, i + 1, j, index + 1) ||  // down
            dfs(board, word, i, j - 1, index + 1) ||  // left
            dfs(board, word, i, j + 1, index + 1);     // right

        // Backtrack
        board[i][j] = temp;

        return found;
    }
