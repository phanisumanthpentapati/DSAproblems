![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
- haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
