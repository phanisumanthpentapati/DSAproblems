# Majority Element

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return  *the majority element*.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.

 

 **Follow-up:**  Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?

                candidate = num;
            }

            if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        return candidate;
    }
}
```
